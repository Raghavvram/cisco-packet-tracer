Step-by-Step Instructions
Create the Topology:

Open Cisco Packet Tracer and create a new project.

Add the following devices to the workspace:

Two Cisco 2911 routers (R1 and R2)

One web server

One PC

Connect the devices according to the IP address table provided.

Configure Router R1:

Click on Router R1 and access the CLI.

Enter the following commands to configure the interfaces:

enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
interface Serial0/0/0
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
clock rate 64000
no shutdown
exit
end
write memory
Configure Router R2:

Click on Router R2 and access the CLI.

Enter the following commands to configure the interfaces:

enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
interface Serial0/0/0
ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252
no shutdown
exit
end
write memory
Configure the Web Server:

Click on the Web Server and access the Desktop tab.

Select the IP Configuration option and enter the following details:

IP Address: 192.168.1.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1
Enable the DNS server and add a DNS record:

Enable DNS Server: Yes
Add a DNS Record: www.example.com 192.168.1.2
Enable HTTP and HTTPS services:

HTTP Server: On
HTTPS Server: On
Configure the PC:

Click on the PC and access the Desktop tab.

Select the IP Configuration option and enter the following details:

IP Address: 192.168.2.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1
DNS Server: 192.168.1.2
Verify Connectivity:

Ping the web server from the PC to verify connectivity:

ping 192.168.1.2
Open a web browser on the PC and access the web server using the DNS name:

http://www.example.com
https://www.example.com
By following these steps, you should be able to set up the web server with DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS in Cisco Packet Tracer successfully. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

give the netowrk topoloy like each device name and the interface they are connected to each and also give the table along with interface ip address and device name, along with commands return a comprehensive documentation
Sure, here's a comprehensive documentation for setting up a network topology with DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS in Cisco Packet Tracer, including device names, interfaces, and commands.
